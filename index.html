                        Hi, my name is Jeff Cheema, an aspiring programmer who strives to create clean and efficient code. I aim to land a job as a computer programming after completing a masters in either computer science or math. Ever since I wrote my first line of code in 4th grade, I have fallen in love with programming. Since then I’ve been exploring different programming languages and learning different skills and techniques to help better the software development process. 
                        <br>
                        Currently I am a senior at Dublin High School enrolled in AP Calculus BC, Honors Digitals Electronics, and other courses. At DHS, I’ve joined clubs such as Robotics and have even founded a club as I pursue my passion in engineering. Throughout high school I’ve met many people who are just as driven as me and I have learned from them, worked with them, and grew both as an engineer and a person through our shared experiences. Outside of engineering and programming, I love to learn foreign languages. You can find my Duolingo profile <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/jsch.io" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                        <br>
                        Outside of school, most of time is invested in developing software or doing robotics. As a member of our school’s robotics’s club for the past 3 years, I have had the privilege to hold an officer position and organize the club's development program which helps educate students in the fundamentals of engineering design and programming. I also help run the school’s environmental technology club and we have organized surveys of various local wildlife habitats in collaboration with East Bay Regional Parks.

                            This project was meant to have multiple seven segment displays cycle through four different displays. Our group decided on the tongue twister "SHE SELL SEASHELL bY THE SEASHOrE". To design the circuit our group created truth tables for each display then came up with logic expressions for each display. The logic expression was then simplified and corresponding AOI, NAND, and NOR implementations were created. The most effecient implementation for each display was chosen and then put together into one big circuit.

                            The goal of the project was to have a circuit that was meant indicate to the driver if it was safe to drive their car. The circuit took in a variety of inputs such as temperature, gas tank level, seat belts, and doors. Our group split up the sensors amongst of ourselves and each made our own circuits that used the sensors as inputs and passed the signal through a set of logic gates. My responsibility was to make a circuit that took used the air pressure of the tires to determine if the car was safe to drive. I was also responsible for documenting our solution and helping put together all of our circuits into one circuit. You can find our documentation

                            The goal of this project was to find a programming library and study its use cases. My partner and I decided to make a music app using Express.js and Youtube-Dl. We also used Xiami music APIs to search for songs and used the search data to fetch the audio files from youtube. The front end design library we used was Material Lite design. Material design is a design philosphy designed by Google and is used throughout their app ecosystem on both Android and iOS. So to provide a more consistent user experience on Android we decided to use Material Design Lite which provided us with a simple CSS and JS library to make out app look nice. We also used a templating system on the front end which takes in a JSON list and repeats it automatically given and html code. We used the HTML5 Media API to provide a notification in the system notification tray giving you full media control over the music being played. The final product had an a fully functional album view page and a search page. The search page is also is fully functional providing album art, track title, and album title.

                           This was my first project in the AP Computer Science coursee. It provided me with a first hand experience with java. This was also my first time using Java on a project. As someone very familiar with other object oriented programming languages such as Javsacript and Python, it was very easy to learn how java code is structured. To make my animation I used a variety of math methods such Math.random() and I also had to use GIMP to size down the my picture. My Github branch of the project can be found

                           In this project my partner and I had to come up with a cost effecient yet effective bridge under $300,000 and under 24 meters from the ground. We had to use West Point Bridge Designer 2016 to both build and simulate our bridge desings. My partner and I brainstormed various ideas for a potential bridge and evaluted each in a decision matrix and chose the one that scored the highest. The criteria in our chart were cost, integrity, amount of materials, and aesthetics. Our final design (picture to the side) used a simple Warren truss that is common in bridges throughout the world. Throughout this project my responsibilities were designing 2 initial designs and documenting each one as well as helping decide on a final decision. I ensured that my responsibilities were taken care of by dividing my workload amongst the days I had to work as well as checking in with my partner to ensure everything was going as planned.

To maximize the efficiency of the system we did various things such as changing the gear ratio, increasing the diameter of the wheel, and using bars instead of c-channels. Throughout this project I learned how to effectively manage space and distribute weight in order to maximize speed. In this project I did a good amount of building and documentation. When helping build we ran into multiple challenges, one of them being mounting the breadboard, which forced me to think creatively and ulitmately produced a unique mounting solution. My responsibilities in this project were to build and document our solution. I carried these responsibilities by ensuring the documentation was updated daily and making sure that our build progress aligned with the

                                    The purpose of the app is to have multiple resizable video players that can be in full screen. In order to make our app different from the base app, we will be adding a list function, where you can select videos from a list, rather than just being able to play a limited amount of videos on the main screen.

                                            We used a 3rd party server to extract the stream url to set as the source for the video player. We did this as appinventor cannot play videos through the web-view blocks.

                                    In making this app, we had ambitious goals in beginning. Over time we realized App Inventors Limits. We wanted to play Youtube videos through the web-view component, but App inventor does not support videos on the web, only videos on the video player. So we came up with another solution, connect the app to a pre-existing API to fetch youtube videos and their sources. We came up with a solution that can be used in many different contexts and makes up for the shortcomings of the web-view. Although our solution is far from perfect, it is usable in the context of the videowall. We switched at the last minute to a drop down list as a lot of search terms can not be parsed to be URL safe, thus we gave the user a list options to choose from. Another problem that we could not fix was the resizing issue, the button would not work properly even though the code is identical to its tutorial counterpart. There is a lot of things we could do better but we did not have the time to, we focused more on getting App inventor to pull videos from youtube, the core concept of our app. As we developed further in our app, we realized that we were starting to the solve the problem in the world that we set out with on this journey, to be able to watch youtube videos at once on the same screen. Although we did not fully solve as the user cannot search to his/her’s content, we did manage to get a select few videos to work. In the end we did get something that works and works well besides the few inevitable errors that make into the final product. My main responsibility was to program the solution as well as to document our solution.

                           After much brainstorming, my development partner and I decided to tackle a problem. Endless runners were boring and repetitive. We attempted to fix this by creating a game that has many obstacles and presents a challenge by getting harder over time. We used Scratch and documented most of it on Google Drive. My responsibility in this project was mainly to help program and doucment our solution. You can find the final product

                        Since I began High School my experience with engineering grew and most of them are thanks to Dublin High School's engineering program. As a student of the Dublin High's Engineering Academy, I am able to attend various field trip and listen to a wide range of guest speakers from throughout the industry. One of the most memorable field trips was the one to California State University Maritime Academy (Cal Maritime). I was surprised to find out that this was the only maritime academy on the west coast. At Cal Maritime, I was given a tour of the campus and an idea of how daily life at the campus is, and it opened my eyes to a different view on how college can be. Cal Maritime takes a more hands on approach on learning, something that differentiates it from other colleges. On this field trip I realized that prestigious colleges may not provide everything needed to succeed in life, Cal Maritime provides hands on experience as well help on all different aspects of an engineering jobs. One thing I found interesting was that they even give lessons on etiquette as well. Cal Maritime also made mechanical engineering much more appealing, I’ve always thought that it was set in stone that I would go into computer science as a major, but now after the field trip I consider both mechanical engineering and computer science equally as valid options as a major.

                        <br>
                        I also went on other field trips to places such as the Autodesk Headquarters. I saw how other people have been using Autodesk software as a way to design, prototype, and communicate their ideas. I also went on a virtual field trip to the Livermore Airport where I learned about how the airport operates and everything that goes into having a successful take off and landing.

                        Throughout my time in the Engineering Academy, I’ve had the opportunity to listen to various different guest speakers. The most interesting guest speaker in my opinion was Maher Salloum. He had a profound impact on my view of how the things you learn in school can be transferred to real life problems. In his presentation he went over two main things: data compression and cancer research. His explanation on data compression showed how he and his team came up with a solution by developing an algorithm to compress data with little loss of quality. His next topic was using magnets to heat up metal to remove cancer cells. His team used a combination of chemistry and biology to tackle a problem that takes the lives of millions each year. His talk, specifically his cancer research that he described, sparked an interest in biotechnology for me.

                        <br>
                        Another guest speaker that I enjoyed listening to was Jason Yosinski who works as a software engineer at Uber. He had an in depth presentation about machine learning and how machine learning algorithms interpret and process data. He showed many demonstrations showing how computers visualize and read images coming in from a camera. He also talked about the real life applications of image recognitions and other machine learning algorithms and how they can be used to solve real world problems.

                        <br>
                        At the Engineering Academy, I was also able to join its mentorship program where I met Paul O'Flynn. Paul works as a software engineer at Workday and was able to give me an insight on how it is to work as a software developer at a large scale company. He also provided invaluable advice on how to choose which college to apply to and how to handle difficult interview questions. Overall, I had a very positive experience in the mentorship program and I am grateful to all the teachers and volunteers who made it happen.
